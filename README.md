### The Sparks Foundation - Machine Learning Tasks
This repository consist of the tasks given during my internship at The Sparks Foundation


## Task 1 - Exploring Supervised Machine Learning

In this regression task we will predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied.
This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just two variables.

What will be predicted score if a student study for 9.25 hrs in a day? 

# linear relationship between scores and hours
